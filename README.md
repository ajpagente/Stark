## Generate test reports with ease
Stark is a test report generator that takes test results in csv format and generates an HTML report. The report template and code is based on [xcpretty](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty). However, unlike xcpretty that is designed to use with xcodebuild, Stark is independent of development platform. You can generate any test report from a csv defined in a specific format.
